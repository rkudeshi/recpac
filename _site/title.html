Once a session begins, refunds will be given only for medical emergencies with a doctor’s certification. Absences and personal scheduling conflicts are not reimbursable. A $10 processing fee per child, per week, will be applied to all approved refunds. Approved refunds will be credited to your Parktakes member account.</p>
